# react-d3-svg-graph
Created with CodeSandbox https://codesandbox.io/s/mm3o3484yx

I want to compare in this project graph drawing components made with different technologies.

1. React Component + d3.js rendering
2. Pure React component with react-spring animation
3. Pure React without animation

After cloning you can install with `npm i` and you can run with `npm start`

Try to delete and add nodes. Edit config parameters. And you can compare the different graphs updates.
