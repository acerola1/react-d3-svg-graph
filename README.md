# Original goal - Comparing d3.js with react-spring

Created with CodeSandbox https://codesandbox.io/s/ox7o6n5w8q

I want to compare in this project graph drawing components made with different technologies.

1. React Component + d3.js rendering
2. Pure React component with react-spring animation
3. Pure React without animation

**Installing**
Clone branch d3-vs-react-spring
`git clone -b d3-vs-react-spring --gingle-branch https://github.com/acerola1/react-d3-svg-graph.git`
After cloning you can install with `npm i` and you can run with `npm start`

Try to delete and add nodes. Edit config parameters. And you can compare the different graphs updates.

The final conclusion is, that with React + react-spring we can achive near the same kind of functionality as with d3.js. And this way it is not neccessary to learn a new technology to React.
